# Libdemfall


This document is a copy of the RMarkdown file used to generate [Three ways to measure liberal democracy in the world](https://www.jordimas.cat/post/2022-03-10-vdemfall/). Notice that the document uses three datasets:
- V-Dem v12
- Penn World Tables v10
- Countrycode

The figures are referenced using the RMarkdown sintaxis: \@ref(fig:name). However, this referencing system does not work in a normal RMarkdown output (it does work with webpages created with Bookdown or Blogdown).
